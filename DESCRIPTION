Title: Volcano Plot for Clinical Trial Adverse Events
Description: Interactive adverse event (AE) volcano plot for monitoring clinical trial safety. This tool allows users to view the overall distribution of AEs in a clinical trial using standard (e.g. MedDRA preferred term) or custom (e.g. Gender) categories using a volcano plot similar to proposal by Zink et al. (2013) <doi:10.1177/1740774513485311>. This tool provides a stand-along shiny application and flexible shiny modules allowing this tool to be used as a part of more robust safety monitoring framework like the Shiny app from the 'safetyGraphics' R package.
